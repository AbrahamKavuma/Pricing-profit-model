Sure, I can modify the above GitHub readme to incorporate the name of the program. Here is the updated version:

# Prototype_Model

This is a Python program that simulates an actuarial pricing and profit testing model for a life insurance policy. The program is named Prototype_model and it is intended to demonstrate the basic functionality and logic of the model. The program takes the following inputs from the user:

- Age: The age of the policyholder at the time of purchase
- Gender: The gender of the policyholder (male or female)
- Preferred sum assured: The amount of coverage that the policyholder wants to buy
- Desired term: The number of years that the policyholder wants to keep the policy

The program then calculates the annual premium that the policyholder would pay for the policy, based on the inputs and some actuarial assumptions. The program also calculates the profitability of the policy for the company, based on the expected cash flows, expenses, and discount rate.

The program outputs the following results:

- Premium: The monthly premium that the policyholder would pay for the policy
- Profit margin: The percentage of profit that the company would make from the policy
- Net present value: The present value of the net cash flows from the policy

The program uses pandas and numpy libraries to perform the calculations and display the results.

## Installation

To run Prototype_Model, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You also need to install pandas and numpy libraries using pip or conda. You can clone this repository or download it as a zip file and then navigate to the project directory. Then, you can run the following commands to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run Prototype_Model, you can use the following command from the project directory:

```bash
python Prototype_Model.py
```

The program will prompt you to enter your inputs and then display the results. You can also modify the actuarial assumptions in the code if you want to change them.

## Limitations and future work

Prototype_Model is a simplified version of an actuarial pricing and profit testing model. It does not account for some factors that may affect the premiums and profitability of a life insurance policy, such as changing mortality rates, lapse rates, taxes etc. It also assumes a constant interest rate and a fixed sum assured and values for commisision and expenses that may not be an actual depiction of the economy.

In future work, I plan to improve Prototype_Model by adding more features and functionalities, such as:

- Allowing different payment modes, such as annual, semi-annual, quarterly, etc.
- Allowing different benefit options, such as riders, dividends, bonuses, etc.
- Incorporating more realistic actuarial assumptions based on data and experience
- Performing sensitivity analysis and scenario testing within the model
- Creating a graphical user interface and a dashboard for better visualization and interaction
